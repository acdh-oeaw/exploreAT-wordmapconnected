# Word-Source Relations
_This project comes from the split of the original [exploreAT-collectionexplorer](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/exploreAT-collectionexplorer) of [Alex Benito](https://github.com/ale0xb)_

Geographical exploration of Lemmas, including filtering and relations between words based on the source they appear in when clicking on any of them.

The prototype allows for word/text searches. Individual results of words are displayed on a map to show their geographical location and distribution according to the same source. Narrowing results to word categories or according to time are possible. Hovering over individual entries on the map gives information on lemma, location and source and their possible connections.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Dependencies are been migrated from [Bower](https://bower.io/) with [bower-away](https://github.com/sheerun/bower-away). Therefore yarn or npm may be used for installing
the dependencies.

As indicated in **Bower** official site, it is recommended not to use it to manage the dependencies.

```
yarn
```
or
```
npm install
```

You can use any static server of your choice to serve the files for the webpage.
Additionally, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) may be used for compiling the source code
and package it into a few files (friendlier with download speed for the webpage).

**This prototype needs for a ElasticSearch database from which to retrieve RDF data and a set of json files from which to get the geo data.**
